From 2007-2019 this data element was derived from up to two conditions that could be selected, WEATHER1 and WEATHER2, based on a hierarchy. The two coded data elements were discontinued after 2019 and moved to the Discontinued Accident Data Elements at the end of the Accident Data File section. Beginning in 2020 all applicable atmospheric conditions are selected and stored in the Weather data file, and this data element is derived from those multiple responses using the same hierarchy. See Appendix B: Rules for Derived Data Elements for an explanation of how this data element is derived. Prior to 2015 the Data Element ID was C25. Prior to 2007 one value was coded for atmospheric conditions. From 2007-2019 up to two values could be selected. If more than two atmospheric conditions were reported, the two conditions that most affect visibility were selected. Accident.WEATHER1 and Accident.WEATHER2 were the coded data elements, and Accident.WEATHER was derived from these two. The two coded data elements were discontinued after 2019. Beginning in 2020 all applicable atmospheric conditions are selected and stored in the Weather data file. Only the derived data element WEATHER is still stored in the Accident data file. It is now derived from the multiple responses in the Weather data file using the same hierarchy. Prior to 2015 the Data Element ID was C25. Prior to 2020 this data element identified up to two values. If more than two atmospheric conditions were reported, the two conditions that most affect visibility were selected.

Beginning in 2020 all applicable atmospheric conditions are selected and stored in this data file. Only the derived data element WEATHER is still stored in the Accident data file and is now derived from the responses in this data file using the same hierarchy.","99","Unknown","1","1","1","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

If a trafficway has two lanes going north immediately adjacent to two lanes going south, one continuous cross-section of roadway, then the number of lanes is coded as four.

For example: If (VNUM_LAN= 2) AND (VTRAFWAY=1), then one has a two-lane roadway that is not physically divided, which is what most people think of as a two-lane road (i.e., one lane going in each direction). If the roadway is a divided trafficway, the number of travel lanes counts only lanes in the direction of travel of the first harmful event.

"FARS","vehicle","VNUM_LAN","vnum_lan","Total Lanes in Roadway",NA,"The number of lanes refers to the number of lanes of a continuous cross-section of roadway. For example, a local roadway with one lane going north and one lane going south would be coded as two lanes. However, if a trafficway is a divided highway with two lanes going north, a median, and two lanes going south, then the number of lanes is coded as two. If a trafficway has two lanes going north immediately adjacent to two lanes going south, one continuous cross-section of roadway, then the number of lanes is coded as four. This data element can be used with the Trafficway Description data element VTRAFWAY to determine the trafficway geometry. For example: If (VNUM_LAN= 2) AND (VTRAFWAY=1), then one has a two-lane roadway that is not physically divided, which is what most people think of as a two-lane road (i.e., one lane going in each direction). If the roadway is a divided trafficway, the number of travel lanes counts only lanes in the direction of travel of the first harmful event. If the roadway is an undivided trafficway, the number of travel lanes are all the lanes regardless of their direction of travel.

From 2007-2019 this data element was derived from up to two conditions that could be selected, WEATHER1 and WEATHER2, based on a hierarchy. The two coded data elements were discontinued after 2019 and moved to the Discontinued Accident Data Elements at the end of the Accident Data File section. Beginning in 2020 all applicable atmospheric conditions are selected and stored in the Weather data file, and this data element is derived from those multiple responses using the same hierarchy.
